hey in this app the we have to transform the alarm functionality to the best every like any smartphone system default alarm app is.

Key objectives:
- Full offline capability. All alarms, schedules, and user preferences must be stored locally (SQLite, localStorage, or device file system or what is the best like system default alarm apps).
- Alarms must trigger accurately even without internet or app being open.
- Allow users to import or select local audio/music files (mp3, wav, etc.) as alarm tones.
- Keep optional cloud sync (using S3 or your API) only for backup or cross-device restore, never required for operation.
- Enable multiple alarms with:
  - Repeat days
  - Custom names
  - Snooze / dismiss logic
  - Adjustable volume and vibration
- Add local notification + background wakeup for mobile devices (use WorkManager / flutter_local_notifications / react-native-background-fetch).
- Build a native-feeling alarm ring screen with big dismiss + snooze buttons and animation support.
- Ensure reliability during Doze mode, screen off, or browser minimized states.
- Provide smooth UI for:
  - Creating and editing alarms
  - Browsing and testing tones
  - Viewing upcoming alarms
- Use a modular architecture:
  - UI Layer
  - Alarm Scheduler Core
  - Local Storage Layer
  - Notification & Audio Player Layer
- Include fallback handling for devices with restricted background execution.
- Use system-native APIs whenever possible (e.g., Android AlarmManager, iOS NotificationCenter).
- Ensure minimal battery drain while maintaining precision.
- Keep UX minimal and elegant — fast setup, instant load, no lag.

Technical stack preferences:
- Cross-platform support (React Native or Flutter).
- Local database (SQLite or Hive).
- Background execution (WorkManager, background_fetch, or service workers for web).
- Audio handling through local media libraries (no dependency on internet).
- Battery- and permission-safe implementation ready for production.

make it production-grade fully working offline alarm that feel as natural and reliable as system alarms.
