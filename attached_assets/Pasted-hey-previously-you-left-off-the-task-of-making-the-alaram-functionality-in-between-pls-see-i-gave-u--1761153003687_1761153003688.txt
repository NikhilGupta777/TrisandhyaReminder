hey previously you left off the task of making the alaram functionality in between pls see i gave u this task:

hey in this app the we have to transform the alarm functionality to the best every like any smartphone system default alarm app is.

Key objectives:

    Full offline capability. All alarms, schedules, and user preferences must be stored locally (SQLite, localStorage, or device file system or what is the best like system default alarm apps).
    Alarms must trigger accurately even without internet or app being open.
    Allow users to import or select local audio/music files (mp3, wav, etc.) as alarm tones.
    Keep optional cloud sync (using S3 or your API) only for backup or cross-device restore, never required for operation.
    Enable multiple alarms with:
        Repeat days
        Custom names
        Snooze / dismiss logic
        Adjustable volume and vibration
    Add local notification + background wakeup for mobile devices (use WorkManager / flutter_local_notifications / react-native-background-fetch).
    Build a native-feeling alarm ring screen with big dismiss + snooze buttons and animation support.
    Ensure reliability during Doze mode, screen off, or browser minimized states.
    Provide smooth UI for:
        Creating and editing alarms
        Browsing and testing tones
        Viewing upcoming alarms
    Use a modular architecture:
        UI Layer
        Local Storage Layer
        Notification & Audio Player Layer
    Include fallback handling for devices with restricted background execution.
    Use system-native APIs whenever possible (e.g., Android AlarmManager, iOS NotificationCenter).
    Keep UX minimal and elegant â€” fast setup, instant load, no lag.
    Technical stack preferences:
    ...
