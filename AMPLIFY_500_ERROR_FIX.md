# AWS Amplify 500 Error - FIXED

## Problem Identified

Your AWS Amplify deployment was getting a **500 Internal Server Error** because AWS Amplify does **not** automatically set `NODE_ENV=production` in the compute environment.

### Root Cause

When `NODE_ENV` is not set to "production", Express defaults to "development" mode. This caused your server to:

1. Try to load the Vite dev server with `setupVite(app, server)`
2. Attempt to import `vite.config.ts` and other development files
3. **FAIL** because these files don't exist in the production build (only `index.js` exists in `.amplify-hosting/compute/default/`)
4. Crash on every request, returning HTTP 500

### The Solution

Added environment detection at the top of `server/index.ts` to **force production mode** when running in AWS:

```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: Force production mode in AWS Amplify environment
if (process.env.AWS_EXECUTION_ENV || process.env.AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME || process.env.AMPLIFY_BRANCH) {
  process.env.NODE_ENV = "production";
  console.log("ðŸ”§ Detected AWS environment - forcing NODE_ENV=production");
}
```

This ensures:
- âœ… AWS Amplify uses `serveStatic(app)` instead of `setupVite()`
- âœ… Static files are served from `compute/default/public/`
- âœ… Local development still uses Vite dev server
- âœ… No Vite-related imports in production

## What To Do Next

### 1. Commit and Push the Fix

```bash
git add server/index.ts
git commit -m "Fix: Force production mode in AWS Amplify to prevent 500 error"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Wait for Amplify to Rebuild

AWS Amplify will automatically detect the push and trigger a new deployment. Wait for it to complete (usually 3-5 minutes).

### 3. Verify the Fix

Once deployed, check the Amplify logs in the AWS Console. You should see:

```
ðŸ”§ Detected AWS environment - forcing NODE_ENV=production
âœ… Static file serving configured
âœ… Express app initialized for AWS Amplify
```

Then visit your URL: https://main.d2nshwfv6xcw10.amplifyapp.com

The app should now load successfully!

### 4. Monitor Deployment Logs

If you still see errors, check the Amplify **Monitoring** tab for:
- Function logs (CloudWatch logs for the compute function)
- Any runtime errors or missing environment variables

## Technical Details

### Before the Fix

```
Development Mode (Express default)
    â†“
setupVite() called
    â†“
Tries to import vite.config.ts
    â†“
File not found in production
    â†“
500 Error
```

### After the Fix

```
AWS Environment Detected
    â†“
NODE_ENV forced to "production"
    â†“
serveStatic() called
    â†“
Serves files from compute/default/public/
    â†“
âœ… App works!
```

## Environment Variables Check

Make sure these are set in Amplify Console â†’ **Environment variables**:

**Required:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Neon PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`

**Optional but recommended:**
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - For email functionality
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_BUCKET_NAME`, `S3_REGION` - For file uploads
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - For Google OAuth

**Note:** Do NOT manually set `NODE_ENV` in Amplify environment variables - the code now handles this automatically.

## Verification Checklist

After deployment completes:

- [ ] App homepage loads without 500 error
- [ ] Static assets (CSS, JS, images) load correctly
- [ ] API routes work (test `/api/health` if available)
- [ ] Authentication flows work
- [ ] Database connections succeed

## Support

If you still encounter issues after deploying this fix:

1. Check Amplify **Monitoring** â†’ **Function logs** for error details
2. Verify all required environment variables are set
3. Check that your database URL is accessible from AWS Amplify's region
4. Review the build logs to ensure the postbuild script ran successfully

**Status:** âœ… Fix applied and tested locally
**Next step:** Push to GitHub and let Amplify rebuild
